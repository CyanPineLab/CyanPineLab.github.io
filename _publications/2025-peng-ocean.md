## Abstract
This study presents a deep learning evaluation framework for 3D reconstruction of mesopelagic thermohaline structures. We integrate multi-source satellite and in-situ observations (1993-2019) to benchmark six neural architectures (FNN, LSTM, U-Net, Earthformer, EarthformerKAN, IMLP) across three ocean basins. Results demonstrate U-Net's superior performance in temperature/salinity reconstruction, while EarthformerKAN achieves comparable salinity accuracy. Models show optimal performance at 150-300m depths with characteristic U-shaped vertical error distribution. Seasonal analysis reveals Earthformer's minimal interannual variability versus U-Net's spring/fall advantages. OceanNNEval establishes the first open-source benchmark for mesopelagic reconstruction, providing an extensible platform for ocean state estimation.
