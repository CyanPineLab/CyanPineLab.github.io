## Abstract

In this paper, we develop a multi-scale model to simulate the aggregation of platelets in a low shear-coefficient flow. In this multi-scale model, the Morse potential is used to describe the interaction between the $αIIbβ3$ receptor and fibrinogen, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is used to simulate fluids on the macro-scale, and the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) is used to simulate the fine-scale receptors' biochemical reactions. Moreover, with the assistance of the high-throughput simulations on the heterogeneous cluster, we calibrate the parameters for the Morse potential which are critical in the proper simulation of the aggregation of platelets. With this model, we simulate the long-term behaviour of thrombus formation constructed by many platelets. Our simulating results are consistent with in-vitro experiments on contact areas and detaching forces. Moreover, it reduces the computational cost significantly.
