## Abstract

Local superconvergence properties of the post-processed finite volume element method (FVEM) are studied. Some interpolation/extrapolation post-processing techniques are applied to a class of $k$ th-order ($k\geqâ€‰2$) FVE solutions for elliptic equations. A local analysis tool for the finite volume method is developed to analyze the proposed method, and some superconvergence results are established. The theoretical findings are supported by several numerical experiments.
