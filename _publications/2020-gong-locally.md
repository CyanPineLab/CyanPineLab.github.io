## Abstract

Local superconvergence properties of the post-processed finite volume element method (FVEM) are studied. Some interpolation/extrapolation post-processing techniques are applied to a class of $k$ th-order ($k\geqâ€‰2$) FVE solutions for elliptic equations. A local analysis tool for the finite volume method is developed to analyze the proposed method, and some superconvergence results are established. The theoretical findings are supported by several numerical experiments.

. In this paper, we post-process the finite element solutions for parabolic equations to meet discrete conservation laws in element-level. The post-processing procedure are implemented by two different approaches : one is by computing a globally continuous flux function and the other is by computing the so-called finite-volume-element-like solution. Both approaches only require to solve a small linear system on each element of the underlying mesh. The post-processed flux converges to the exact flux with optimal convergence rates. Numerical computations verify our theoretical findings.
