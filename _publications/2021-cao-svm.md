## Abstract

This paper is concerned with the analysis of two spectral volume (SV) methods for 1D scalar hyperbolic equations : one is constructed basing on the Gaussâ€“Legendre points (LSV) and the other is based on the right-Radau points (RRSV). We first prove that for a general nonuniform mesh and any polynomial degree k, both the LSV and RRSV methods are stable and can achieve optimal convergence orders in the $L^2$ norm. Secondly, we prove that both methods have some superconvergence properties at some special points. For instances, at the downwind points, the solution of RRSV and LSV methods converges with the order of $O(h^{2k+1})$ and $O(h^{2k})$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that for constant-coefficient equations, the RRSV method is identical to the upwind discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. Our theoretical findings are validated with several numerical experiments at the end.
