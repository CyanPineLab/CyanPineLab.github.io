Program SV for 1D hyperbolic conservation laws
------
* [Download Codes](https://github.com/CyanPineLab/Codes.git)
* Matlab Codes
* Using Spectral (finite) volume method
* Solve 1D hyperbolic conservation laws $u_t + u_x = 0$.
* Need to set $[a, b]$, $u_0 = u(x,0)$, N (SV numbers), k (Degree of Polynomail on each SV), type (Division points at SV, include Equidistant, Gauss points, Gauss-Lobatto points, Gauss-Radau points) and T_num (Time step numbers).
* Return numerical result, images and error analysis.

Program Implicit RK for ordinary differential equation
------
* [Download Codes](https://github.com/CyanPineLab/Codes.git)
* Matlab Codes
* Using Implicit Runge-Kutta method
* Solve ordinary differential equation $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$.
* Need to set $[a, b]$, $y_0 = y(a)$, N (Time step numbers), k (Degree of RK), type (Division points at SV, include Equidistant, Gauss points, Gauss-Lobatto points, Gauss-Radau points).
* Return numerical result and images.

Rerference
------
* [Clawpack](http://www.clawpack.org/) >> Clawpack is a collection of finite volume methods for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Clawpack employs high-resolution Godunov-type methods with limiters in a general framework applicable to many kinds of waves. Clawpack is written in Fortran and Python.

* [Opencfd-sc2D](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1slfC5Yl?_at_=1641785935729) >> Opencfd-sc2d Ver 2.0 uses finite difference method to solve two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations in curvilinear coordinate system.

* [PyPDE](https://pypde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) >> A Python library for solving any system of hyperbolic or parabolic Partial Differential Equations. The PDEs can have stiff source terms and non-conservative components.

* [MATH 0471: Multiphysics integrated computational project](https://github.com/tgregov/Multiphysics) >> This repository contains the implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) applied to systems of possibly coupled non-linear hyperbolic equations, i.e. to physical conservative systems. The geometry is currently assumed to be two-dimensional. The targeted physical application was chosen to be the shallow water equations, but any new system of equations can easily be implemented, by adding new physical fluxes or sources.
